<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My baby loves this dish. The dill gives it a buttery tast and the asparagus fits a deeper flavor profile and a
    crunchyt mouth feel.</p>

        Heat a dry large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until beginning to smoke. Pour in 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil,
        then
        add 1 lb. ground lamb and use a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to press meat into a thin layer. Sprinkle with
        1
        tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, season with freshly ground black pepper, and scatter one 2"
        piece
        ginger, peeled, finely chopped, over. Cook, undisturbed, until lamb is deeply browned underneath, about 5
        minutes.

        Break up meat into bite-size pieces, then add 6 scallions, thinly sliced, 1 lb. asparagus, woody ends trimmed,
        sliced on a diagonal ½" thick, and ½ cup finely chopped dill fronds and tender stems. Season with salt and
        pepper.
        Cook, tossing often, until lamb is cooked through and asparagus is bright green and just crisp-tender, about 2
        minutes (it’s okay if asparagus is still a little crunchy—it will continue to soften off the heat). Taste and
        add
        more salt and pepper if needed. Scatter finely grated zest of ½ lemon over.

        Divide stir-fry among bowls or plates and top with more dill. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.
